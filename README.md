# Historical Pittsburgh Crash Heat Map

My research project for my Summer Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship @ CMU, May - Aug 2025. 
This repository contains data and scripts for analyzing crash data in Pittsburgh. The primary objective of my research is to develop a crash-prediction model for heavy-duty vehicles (HDV) by creating a model based on historical crash records. My final project can be seen below in the screenshot or accessed via the HTML page linked in this repo (must be opened locally).

My sincere gratitude to my advisors:
- [Pingbo Tang](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/directory/bios/tang-pingbo.html), Ph.D., P.E. || Associate Professor at Carnegie Mellon University  
- Ava Jahan Biglari, Ph.D. Student at Carnegie Mellon University  

And to my teammates:
- Beibei Sun, M.Sc. Rail and Urban Transport || Technical University of Munich (TUM)
- Allison Zhou, Student

<summary><strong>Folder: Allegheny County Crash Data</strong></summary>

This folder contains the bulk of my work, organized in the order I created them.

### 1. Crash Data Cleanup

- **Description**: Cleaned the PENNDOT crash data and extracted the relevant categories and values.
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `pandas`

---

### 2. Density Map

- **Description**: Using the cleaned crash data, created a density map with the **Folium** library.
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `pandas`
  - `branca`
  - `folium`

---

### 3. Time Series Crash Map

- **Description**: Applied a linear time series weight model to the density map to remove noise in the crash data.
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `matplotlib`
  - `numpy`
  - _(plus all libraries used previously)_

---

### Other Graphs

- **Description**: Exploratory analysis on possible crash-causing factors.  
  Each Python file will output a graph of some sort.

<summary><strong>Folder: Greater Pittsburgh Food Bank</strong></summary>

- **Data Source**: CSV file scraped from the Greater Pittsburgh Food Bank [distribution list](https://pittsburghfoodbank.org/get-involved/volunteer/distributions/).
- **Usage**: The merged map overlays the GPFB distribution locations on the crash density map (without time series calculations).

<summary><strong>Folder: Pittsburgh Street Centerline</strong></summary>

This folder contains the original files downloaded from the **City of Pittsburgh GIS Data Hub**:  
[GIS Dataset Link](https://pghgishub-pittsburghpa.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/db12137760a64e86bc4ea74574c4dd30_0/explore?location=40.442481%2C-79.962726%2C13.01)

<details>
<summary><strong>Folder: West End Bridge Map</strong></summary>

This folder contains two OSM files representing the selected sample area: the stretch of the **West End Bridge** and its immediate surroundings.

The area was selected for analysis using **SUMO** and **TraCI** because of:

- **High historical crash density**
- **Simple road geometry** (only a few roads feeding in and out)
- **Length** (longer distances are easier to simulate)
